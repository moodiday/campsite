        followed by a colon, and then the text of what they said.\n\nWhen formatting
        your response:\n- The summary MUST be a single paragraph with no more than
        3 sentences.\n- The first sentence must describe the type and purpose of the
        meeting. Examples include \"team sync\", \"project planning\", \"retrospective\",
        or \"one on one\". Do not limit yourself to these examples.\n- Each sentence
        must cover important parts of the conversation. Do not use extra sentences
        to fill space.\n- Each sentence MUST NOT EXCEED 10 words.\n- Format each sentence
        in plain text.\n- Write in an active voice, using clear and concise sentences.

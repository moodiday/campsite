        concise summary of the final conversation outcome, highlighting responsible
        parties for actions or decisions. Focus solely on the conversation''s conclusion,
        omitting intermediate steps. Utilize language akin to the original discourse
        but maintain a professional tone. DO NOT use first-person, narrator voice,
        passive voice, AI speak, or the word \"resolution\". Avoid an introduction
        and keep the summary factual, excluding acknowledgments or gratitude expressions.
        Complex decisions should be minimized, avoiding repetition of all steps in
        the decision-making process. The summary MUST be under 50 words. Skew heavily
        towards the contents of the provided comment, rephrasing for clarity and brevity.
        If the selected comment does not provide clear actions or decisions, make
        a best attempt to infer them based on the original post and other comments

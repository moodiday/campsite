00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Cliff Rockwell: It says here one o'clock meeting. Who are we meeting with?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.600
Daisy Meadows: Don't worry about it.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.100
Cliff Rockwell: Oh no, please.

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.400
Daisy Meadows: No, it's important to meet with the park rangers.

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.400
Daisy Meadows: They are the first line of defense.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900
Ranger Rick: Daisy Meadows!

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.700
Daisy Meadows: Hey, Reed.

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.300
Ranger Rick: What's up, pencil pushers?

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.299
Ranger Rick: Haverford, good to see you, man.

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.700
Ranger Rick: Is it hot in here?

11
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.400
Ranger Rick: I feel hot. Are you guys hot?

12
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.000
Ranger Rick: How you guys doing? I'm good.

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Ranger Rick: You guys got any snacks?

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.700
Cliff Rockwell: Reed is the head of all outdoor security.

15
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Cliff Rockwell: Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask?

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Cliff Rockwell: Listen.

17
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000
Ranger Rick: Hey, Daisy, have you seen Avatar?

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.799
Ranger Rick: I never saw Avatar.

19
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.700
Ranger Rick: I wanted to read the book first,

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.000
Ranger Rick: but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar.

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.299
Ranger Rick: What'd you guys do for St. Paddy's Day?

22
00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.000
Ranger Rick: I was wearing this t-shirt that said,

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.299
Ranger Rick: kiss me, I'm Irish,

24
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.400
Ranger Rick: but no one would kiss me.

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Ranger Rick: So!

26
00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:54.000
Ranger Rick: You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.

27
00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.099
Daisy Meadows: I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the park safe.

28
00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.500
Ranger Rick: Oh, you think you know how to do my job?

29
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.900
Ranger Rick: Well, you might not be so confident

30
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.300
Ranger Rick: once you've walked a mile on my size sevens.

31
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.099
Daisy Meadows: Kind of small feet.

32
00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.300
Cliff Rockwell: Actually, seven is the worldwide average.

33
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.500
Ranger Rick: Boo!

34
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.300
Reed Marsh: I don't know.

35
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300
Reed Marsh: Daisy, I'd rather be back at the office.

36
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.000
Daisy Meadows: I know this is painful for you, Reed,

37
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Daisy Meadows: but you have to be strong.

38
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.800
Ranger Rick: You guys ready?

39
00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.000
Daisy Meadows: Oh, boy, yeah.

40
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.599
Daisy Meadows: Okay, we're ready.

41
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.400
Ranger Rick: I'm gonna show you guys all the problems we've been facing.

42
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.599
Ranger Rick: I'm gonna show you that we've been doing everything we can.

43
00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.599
Daisy Meadows: I'm looking forward to working together, Reed.

44
00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.599
Ranger Rick: And after that, I'm gonna show you this log I found.

45
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.599
Ranger Rick: It's got, like, 50 worms on it.

46
00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.599
Ranger Rick: I call it Worm Log.

47
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.199
Ranger Rick: Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman.

48
00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:43.199
Ranger Rick: Uh, when I was a kid,

49
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:45.500
Ranger Rick: my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot

50
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.199
Ranger Rick: and just run around till I got tired.

51
00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.300
Ranger Rick: But if there's any criminals out there watching,

52
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
Ranger Rick: I never get tired.

53
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900
Ranger Rick: And ladies, too.

54
00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.500
Cliff Rockwell: This thing is a mess.

55
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.400
Ranger Rick: We used to have three carts, actually.

56
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.599
Ranger Rick: The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.

57
00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.900
Ranger Rick: The second one, raccoons got onto.

58
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.699
Ranger Rick: There was urine everywhere.

59
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:10.100
Ranger Rick: And the third one was recently stolen.

60
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.899
Cliff Rockwell: What's this one?

61
00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
Ranger Rick: This is the second one, the raccoon piss one.

62
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.899
Ranger Rick: All right, so, we're gonna just head out.

63
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.600
Ranger Rick: Oh, no.

64
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Ranger Rick: You know what? I think we got too much weight.

65
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600
Daisy Meadows: Oh.

66
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.199
Daisy Meadows: That's Cliff, probably.

67
00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.500
Cliff Rockwell: Are you serious?

68
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.600
Daisy Meadows: Cliff, can you get off, please?

69
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.100
Daisy Meadows: Just run alongside the cart, okay?

70
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.600
Ranger Rick: Okay, here we go.

71
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.800
Daisy Meadows: Whoa.

72
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.399
Ranger Rick: So, let me tell you a little bit about the park.

73
00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.199
Ranger Rick: Uh, up here on the left is, uh,

74
00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.100
Ranger Rick: one of our most beautiful grass fields.

75
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.500
Ranger Rick: Uh, it's primarily grass.

76
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.000
Ranger Rick: All right, I'm gonna make a hard left here.

77
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.600
Ranger Rick: Stick with us, Cliff.

78
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.000
Ranger Rick: Hey, is this looking familiar?

79
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.600
Reed Marsh: Uh, yeah, it happened right over there.

80
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.199
Ranger Rick: Oh, yeah.

81
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.899
Ranger Rick: I'm not surprised.

82
00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.600
Ranger Rick: Take a look at this path.

83
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600
Ranger Rick: With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light.

84
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
Ranger Rick: There's been 10 assaults already this year.

85
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.800
Daisy Meadows: Wow, really?

86
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.699
Daisy Meadows: Can't you station a park ranger out here?

87
00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.500
Ranger Rick: We have. Who do you think they're assaulting?

88
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.000
Ranger Rick: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.

89
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.800
Daisy Meadows: One way or another, I'm gonna get money

90
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.199
Daisy Meadows: so you can protect Reed and all the other

91
00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.800
Daisy Meadows: helpless, pathetic people in this town.

92
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.199
Cliff Rockwell: Oh.

93
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.800
Cliff Rockwell: You guys gotta slow down.

94
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.000
Cliff Rockwell: You guys taking a rest for a minute?

95
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.399
Daisy Meadows: No, Cliff, sorry, no can do.

96
00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.000
Daisy Meadows: Sun's going down. It's real dangerous out here.

97
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Daisy Meadows: Let's roll, Reed.

98
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.600
Reed Marsh: Okay, going fast.

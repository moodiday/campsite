Traditional daily standups represent an outdated and ineffective way to think about team communication.

### Real-time standups:

- **Interrupt deep work** — breaking flow to hop on a call costs builders time and focus, especially before and after the standup when they’re forced to context switch.
- **Aren’t remote-friendly** — it’s hard to catch up if someone misses the meeting. Without disciplined note-taking, people miss important context about projects.
- **Devolve into decision-making and tangents** — it’s too easy for a standup to veer off track and become a place where teams try to make real-time decisions. This fragments the conversation, may not be relevant for everyone on the call, and makes it hard to find decisions later.

### Standups for distributed teams

We’ve been iterating on our daily standup format at Campsite over the past year and found a system that protects everyone’s time and flow while maximizing visibility and shared context:

1.  A recurring [Zapier automation](https://zapier.com/apps/campsite/integrations) creates a post every day with a simple prompt: _What did you work on today?_
2.  At the end of each person’s workday, we write a short comment on the post; it's usually a few sentences or bullet points.
3.  Comments include links to relevant posts, call summaries, pull requests, and tasks so that people can get more context if needed.

Here’s a real example of a daily update to see how these feel: [Daily Update August 14, 2024](https://app.campsite.com/campsite/posts/s4n74kgx6a6g).

This system has helped us move faster as a distributed team:

- **Supports deep work** — daily updates never interrupt our flow. When people share at the end of _their_ workday, updates are always reflective of a full day’s progress regardless of time zone.
- **Remote-friendly** — if someone is out for a day, it’s easy to catch up. All the context for each day is one place so there’s no need to hop through channels to re-read long chat threads.
- **Focused on impact** — sharing at the end of the day keeps us focused on what _actually_ happened, not what we _thought_ would happen.
- **Easy to skim** — it’s faster to skim a few comments than to sit through a long-winded meeting. Short, info-dense, context-rich comments let people deep-dive into code or separate conversations if needed.
- **Thoughtful side-conversations** — nested comments give us space to ask follow-up questions or share additional context. Sometimes, these side conversations spawn new posts to keep our communication organized.
- **Updates double as a “signing off” message** — end-of-day updates give our distributed team a sense of people’s availability and presence.
- **Self-documenting and transparent** — keeping everything in posts and comments means that daily updates become a log of our progress. Information doesn’t get siloed in private meeting notes or a had-to-be-there chat thread.

Campsite posts, nested comments, and [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/campsite/integrations) make this system easy to implement for any distributed team — [give it a try](https://campsite.com/start).

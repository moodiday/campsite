## Base URL

```
https://api.campsite.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens.

Follow these steps to get an API key for your organization:

1. Go to your Organization settings and click the **Integrations** tab.
2. In the **Custom integrations** box, click the **+ New** button and create a new integration.
3. On the next screen in the **API keys** box, click **Generate API key** and copy the API key that appears.
4. Include the key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <CAMPSITE_API_KEY>
```

## Making requests

Include your bearer token and a Content-Type: application/json header with all requests. Example:

```
curl --request POST \
 --url https://api.campsite.com/v2/posts \
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer <CAMPSITE_API_KEY>' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data '{ "content_markdown": "Post content" }'
```

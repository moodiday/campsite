description: 'Enable direct messaging between users and your integration'

Bot DMs allow users to have private, one-on-one conversations with your integration. When enabled, users can start direct message threads with your integration, which appear in their sidebar with your integration's name and avatar.

## Enabling Bot DMs

To enable direct messaging for your integration:

1. Set up a webhook that listens for the `message.dm` event (see [Webhooks](/api-reference/guides/webhooks))
2. Ensure your webhook is active and responding to events
3. Your integration will automatically appear in the "New Thread" UI with an "app" badge next to its name

<Tip>
  Users will only see your integration in the "New Thread" UI if your webhook is actively listening for the `message.dm`
  event.
</Tip>

## Receiving messages from users

When a user sends a message to your integration, Campsite will send a webhook event with the `message.dm` event type. Here's an example payload:

```json
{
  "id": "dm8h4tnud123",
  "type": "message.dm",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-01T18:30:03Z",
  "organization_id": "jkh4ytt0s18o",
  "application_id": "uc1d5rg02s2y",
  "data": {
    "message": {
      "id": "msg9ecyqn2lf1",
      "content": "Hello bot!",
      "created_at": "2024-10-01T18:30:02.060Z",
      "thread_id": "thd5vvauzu3",
      "sender": {
        "id": "4qteru9o6s08",
        "name": "Ranger Rick",
        "type": "user",
        "avatar_urls": {
          "xs": "https://campsite.imgix.net/...",
          "sm": "https://campsite.imgix.net/...",
          "base": "https://campsite.imgix.net/..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Sending messages to users

To send a direct message to a user, use the [Create DM endpoint](/api-reference/create-dm). This endpoint uses member IDs instead of thread IDs so you can message users without keeping track of a thread ID for each user.

## Bot DM guidelines

- Respond to user messages promptly (within a few seconds when possible)
- Provide feedback when processing longer operations
- Handle errors gracefully with clear error messages
